Embed custom HTML snippets with raw content and variables

== Description ==

Create your HTML snippets or raw PHP code with this plugin. Don't bother anymore with annoying TinyMCE HTML rules, that cleans script or styles tags.
All users allowed to create HTML snippets are able to use also placeholdes: a small piece of text that will be replaced by the value you give to the related attribute.
Administrator users are also allowed to embed raw PHP code that can be executed at display-time.
Want to display the name of the current user? No problem! Display it's IP address? Just go! Store or display session data? Hey, just do!
Improve your editing comfort by installing [iThoughts Advanced Code Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ithoughts-advanced-code-editor/), that set up an awesome web code editor.
It also includes a tiny TinyMCE plugin to link your HTML Snippets with your standard posts.

Enjoy the freedom of setting up everything you want in a simple embeddable custom shortcode.
